# This Dockerfile is used to both document and test building bpftrace on the
# development version of ubuntu. We attempt to catch bugs as early as possible
# which is why we are using devel.
# The original bpftrace Dockerfile.ubuntu file did not include packages for
# debugging and testing, so this one adds all missed dependencies.
